# COVID19-Data-Exploration

## Objective: 
To perform an exploratory anaylsis of the COVID-19 pandemic using BigQuery, and gain insights into the pandemic's death and vaccination numbers.

## Data
(Link to dataset: https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) 


With BigQuery/SQL, I utilized Joins, CTE's, Temp Tables, Windows Functions, Aggregate Functions, Creating Views, and Converting Data Types 


With the help of Alex The Anaylyst on Youtube (https://www.youtube.com/@AlexTheAnalyst) to get me started, I was able to dive further into the dataset and gain more meaningful insight. As a healthcare worker in the US that worked directly in COVID-19 units and throughout the pandemic, I was able to personally relate to the data I explored. While exploring this data, I found some interesting, yet grim, insights. 

For example, as of March 6th, 2023, the United States is the number one country with the highest total death count from COVID-19 with 1,122,264 total deaths. Followed by Brazil (699,276 total deaths) and India (530,775 total deaths). According to the data, 30.64% of the population of the United States has had a confirmed case of COVID-19. 

We can find the percent of each country's population that has received at least one vaccine and the percent of the population that is 'fully vaccinated'. For example, in the United States, about 80% of the population has received at least one vaccine dose and 68% of the population is fully vaccinated.

On a slightly more positive news, the likelihood of death after contracting COVID-19 in the United States today is 1.08%. However, this is only a general percentage and does not take into account for age, gender, vacccination status, etc. I believe this would be an interesting topic to dive deeper into for future exploration!
